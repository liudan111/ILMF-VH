Usage codes
---------------

code/dowload_host_of_virus.py  is used to extract the "isolate host =" or "host" fields from the annotation files downloaded from complete viral genomes of  NCBI

code/dowload_virus.py is used to retrieve the viral genomes from NCBI based on the accession numbers of viruses

code/similarity_os.py and code/main.py are used to calculate Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity between hosts.

The codes of NRLMF,KBMF,NetLapRLS,BLM-NII ,CMF can refer to codes of Yong et al.https://github.com/stephenliu0423/PyDTI [3].

Note:the code is implemented by Python 2.7.9

 Description of datasets
---------------
datasets/dataset I including 71 hosts and 352 viruses which only one specific host genome appeared in the prokaryotic genome database at NCBI[2].

datasets/dataset II including 1075 hosts and 432 viruses which the isolation hosts are all at the species or strain level[2].

datasets/dataset III including 2699 hosts and 820 viruses which is downloaded from RefSeq on 7/25/2015[1].

datasets/onf including onf measures of 352,432 and 820 viruses which are obtained by Jie Ren's tools [2].

Note: Jie Ren's tools is used to get dissimilarity  between viruses,you should transform to similarity.
